<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am a Javascript Engineer, with experience of working with clients across North America, Europe and the Asia.


    I started off with jQuery, and graduated to Angular, and now ReactJS, along with server side development experience on NodeJS with ExpressJS, with experience in ES5, ES6 and ES7 standards.
    
    Having worked in Frontend Development since 2015, I have seen and worked on Responsive Web Design and Development, as they evolved, with experience with semantic HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, Flexbox, Grid and Bootstrap (3 & 4).
    
    Other tools that I work with on a daily basis are Git (especially the GitFlow workflow), JIRA, Babel, Webpack, Mocha+Chai.

    Lately, I have been exploring Functional Programming and Universal (Isomorphic) web applications using React and Redux, Angular Universal etc. I have experience in both Waterfall and Agile Methodologies.
